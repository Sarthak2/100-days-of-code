# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: 25 June 2020
**Today's Progress**:- Started with TOP (The Odin Project). Did some basic initial reading which included but not limited to:
-Motivational Text
-Time Management Techniques
    -Pomodoro
    -Lizard man smthing
-Real life experiences of people who started out in the web dev community and hustled theirway forward

To ensure that I stick to my commitment and myself in check, I plan to do the following things:
- installed [HabitHub](https://thehabithub.com/): A real good app to virtually make any habbit possible. I like the clean interface.
- installed [Boosted](https://www.boostedproductivity.com/): I use this app to keep a track of the the number of hours that I spend each day on my goals.
- installed [Asana](https://asana.com/): I'll use this to plan my upcoming *tasks*.
- installed [Pocket](https://getpocket.com/): This service is used by me to save any supplement pages that I want read in my free time. 

**Thought's**:- On the very first day I figured it out that making *schedule* is very essential. Today I woke up at around 2 PM and the the rest of the day just went down the drain. Still I was able to put in 50+ mins.Most of the time went into setting up stuff.
