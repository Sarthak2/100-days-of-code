# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: 25 June 2020
**Today's Progress**:-
1.) I had no idea of what is the basic idea behind github and how we used it. I also used to get confused with the layout of github and bombardment of so many options. I am finally able to understand good amount of thngs here on github and I am really happy.

**Thought's**:- I am happy that I was able to learn something I had looked forward to for quite some time but was being lazy to actually do it.
**Link to my work** :- N/A
